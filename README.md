# Personal-Odin-Project-Repository

Within this repository, I have housed all of the assignments and projects that are given as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

Each folder within this repository refers to either a lesson or project within the curriculum. For example, the folder '/html_boilerplate' corresponds to the lesson [HTML Boilerplate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate) within the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).
